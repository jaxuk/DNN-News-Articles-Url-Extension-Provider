# DNN-News-Articles-Url-Extension-Provider
Ventrian News Articles Url Extension Provider for DNN 07.01.00 and up. 

This is very much Beta and might be buggy, but it works.

Could be improved by only running the provider for needed pages.

TODO - Implement redirect of URLs matching URLs rendered by the DNN Open Url Rewriter NA Provider to the URLs created by this Provider.
